    <p class="biography-text">
      My journey into software engineering began in 2020 when I transitioned from tech sales to code.
      Since graduating from Fullstack Academy, I have served as a Software Engineer at Dolby Laboratories,
      focusing on delivering intuitive frontend interfaces for complex products. I am now looking for a new
      role where I can apply my full-stack skills and product mindset to impactful challenges.
