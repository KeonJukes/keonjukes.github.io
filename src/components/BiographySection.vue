    <p class="biography-text">
      During 2020's suprise pandemic I decided to make a transition from sales to software
      engineering. After completing Fullstack Academy's software engineering immersive bootcamp, I
      joined Dolby.io as an Associate Software Engineer and have since been working on various
      projects to deliver great user interfaces (UI) and user experiences (UX).
