    <p class="biography-text">
      During 2020's suprise pandemic, I decided to make a transition from tech sales to software
      engineering. After completing Fullstack Academy's software engineering immersive bootcamp, I
      joined Dolby Laboratories as a Software Engineer, where I helped deliver stellar
      frontend experiences for both internal and customer-facing products. I now am working as a
      Sales Engineer at Dolby, assisting both Account Executives and Sales Development Representatives
      with propsecting customers and closing deals.
