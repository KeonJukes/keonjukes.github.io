    <p class="biography-text">
      During 2020's suprise pandemic, I decided to make a transition from tech sales to software
      engineering. After completing Fullstack Academy's software engineering immersive bootcamp, I
      joined Dolby Laboratories as an Associate Software Engineer where I helped deliver stellar
      frontend experiences for both internal and customer-facing products. After two years of
      working on amazing real-time streaming projects, I have been transitioned to the role of a
      solutions engineer to help close deals.
