    <p class="biography-text">
      During 2020's suprise pandemic, I decided to make a transition from tech sales to software
      engineering. After completing Fullstack Academy's software engineering immersive bootcamp, I
      joined Dolby Laboratories as a Software Engineer, where I helped deliver stellar
      frontend experiences for both internal and customer-facing products. 
      
      I am now looking for my next opportunity and am open to work on an ambitious project!
